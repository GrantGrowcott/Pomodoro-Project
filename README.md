# Pomodoro-Project

---

The purpose of this project is to create a productivity application by splitting the users time into blocked time slots. The user has the ability to manually change how long they will focus and the legnth of the breaks they will take. As the session progresses, an on-screen 3 dimensional torus will grow in size to show your overall progress. When the torus has completed its cycle, a break is started and the session begin again.

The notes section is used to track what type of session you completed, the length of your sessions and possible improvements that can be made for future sessions
